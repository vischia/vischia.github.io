## My Research

### NeuroMODE

In the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/) we are studying the machine-learning assisted optimization of experiment design via differentiable programming. We are currently working on applications of this concept to relatively simple experiment designs, but are already facing computational limitations.

NeuroMODE, the project funded by my Ram√≥n y Cajal grant, consists in studying the application of **spiking neural networks** and of **quantum machine learning** to the optimization problems studied by MODE.

**Spiking neural networks** use, instead of point-like perceptrons, spatially extended neurons where the transport of signals is modelled by differential equations: I hope that the increased complexity of these neuron models may help in the optimization of high-dimensional phase spaces.

**Quantum machine learning algorithms** are based on encoding information in Qbits (infinite, continuous states) instead of classical bits (binary 0-1 states): the intrinsic differentiability of quantum algorithms, coupled with the quantum advantage, may represent a natural platform for the kind of optimizations we perform in MODE.
