## Who am I

I am a **Ramón y Cajal senior researcher** at the Universidad de Oviedo and ICTEA since 2021. Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN and then FNRS, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. I got my bachelor and master's degrees from Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy), in my hometown.

My research focuses on the exploration of *high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent*, eventually powered by *quantum algorithms*, and on the extension of machine learning methods to *realistic neurons*.

Sometimes I also *apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data*, within the CMS Collaboration, to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

I am coordinator of the CERN IML (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group, member of the Statistics Committee of the CMS Collaboration, plus other responsibilities within the CMS Collaboration.

## Research Group

I am currently building my own research group. If you want to work with me, either at the bachelor, master's, PhD, or postdoc level, please write me an email at the address below.

I often have some available smaller projects, suitable to interested students who want to acquire some experience or try out research work without (yet?) committing to a bachelor, master's, or PhD thesis. Again, if you are interested please write me an email at the address below.
