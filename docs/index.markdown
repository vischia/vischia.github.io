I am a *Ramón y Cajal senior researcher* at the Universidad de Oviedo and ICTEA. Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN and then FNRS, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. 

My research focuses on the exploration of *high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent*, eventually powered by *quantum algorithms*, and on the extension of machine learning methods to *realistic neurons*.

Sometimes I also *apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data*, within the CMS Collaboration, to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

I am coordinator of the CERN IML (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group, member of the Statistics Committee of the CMS Collaboration, plus other responsibilities within the CMS Collaboration.
