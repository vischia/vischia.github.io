# My Research

### NeuroMODE

In the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/) we are studying the machine-learning assisted optimization of experiment design via differentiable programming. We are currently working on applications of this concept to relatively simple experiment designs, but are already facing computational limitations.

**NeuroMODE**---the project I submitted most recently (January 2022) to the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) and that got funded as a Ram√≥n y Cajal grant (July 2022, to start January 2023)---consists in studying the application of **spiking neural networks** and of **quantum machine learning** to machine learning problems, in particular to the class optimization problems studied by MODE.

  - **Spiking neural networks** use, instead of point-like perceptrons, spatially extended neurons where the transport of signals is modelled by differential equations: the increased complexity of these neuron models may help in the optimization of high-dimensional phase spaces.

  - **Quantum machine learning algorithms** are based on encoding information in Qbits (infinite, continuous states) instead of classical bits (binary 0-1 states): the intrinsic differentiability of quantum algorithms, coupled with the quantum advantage, may represent a natural platform for the kind of optimizations we perform in MODE.
