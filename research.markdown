# My Research

### NeuroMODE


**NeuroMODE**---the project I submitted most recently (January 2022) to the Spanish State Research Agency (AEI) and that got funded as a Ram√≥n y Cajal grant (started January 2023)---consists in studying the application of **spiking neural networks**, **neuromorphic computing**, and **quantum machine learning** to machine learning problems, in particular to the class optimization problems studied by MODE (see below for my MODE activity).

  - **Spiking neural networks** use, instead of point-like perceptrons, spatially extended neurons where the transport of signals is modelled by differential equations: the increased complexity of these neuron models may help in the optimization of high-dimensional phase spaces.

  - **Quantum machine learning algorithms** are based on encoding information in Qbits (infinite, continuous states) instead of classical bits (binary 0-1 states): the intrinsic differentiability of quantum algorithms, coupled with the quantum advantage, may represent a natural platform for the kind of optimizations we perform in MODE.

### MODE

In the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/) we are studying the machine-learning assisted optimization of experiment design via differentiable programming. We are currently working on applications of this concept to relatively simple experiment designs, but are already facing computational limitations. I am founding member and steering board member of the Collaboration.

  - **Muon Tomography Pipeline**: with my collaborators, we are currently working on a software package for the automatic optimization of a muon tomography apparatus. The project has applications, among others, in border control, art preservation, and metallurgic industry.

  - **Neuromorphic computing** employs hardware chips based on spatially extended neurons. Such chips are characterized by a lower power consumption than corresponding digital chips. This new class of hardware can drive down the computing resources needed to solve complex optimization problems.
