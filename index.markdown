# Who am I

I am a **Ramón y Cajal senior researcher** at the Universidad de Oviedo and [ICTEA](https://ictea.uniovi.es/), and **Adjunct Professor** at IITM. Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN postdoc and then FNRS chargé de recherche, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. I got my bachelor and master's degrees from Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy).

My research focuses on the exploration of **high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent**, eventually powered by **quantum algorithms**, and on the extension of machine learning methods to **realistic neurons** with **spiking networks**, to be then implemented in **neuromorphic hardware devices**. I have created my research group in Universidad of Oviedo and ICTEA, focussed on this main research avenue.

**I co-founded and am part of the steering committee of the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/)**, where we focus on experiment design powered by machine-learning-based optimization.

Within ICTEA, I aim at **bridging and promoting cross-contamination** between different disciplines by the development and application of state-of-the-art and novel **artificial intelligence techniques**.

I also **apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data**, within the [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration), to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

My CMS-related responsibilities include being a **coordinator of the CERN IML** (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group, member of the **CMS Statistics Committee** (an advisory committee on topics concerning statistics), plus other responsibilities (e.g. HWW convener) within the CMS Collaboration.

For what concerns my activities in the CMS Collaboration, I joined the excellent [UniOviHEP-ICTEA CMS group](https://www.hep.uniovi.es/).

# My Research Group

**NeuroModelling** (my main project): I am currently building **my own research group**. If you would like to work with me, either at the bachelor, master's, PhD, or postdoc level, please write me an email at the address below.

I may have smaller projects to offer, suitable to interested students who want to acquire some experience or try out research work without (yet?) committing to a bachelor, master's, or PhD thesis. Again, if you are interested please write me an email at the address below.

### Current Postdocs

- If you got your PhD between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2023, and you are interested in a postdoc with me, please contact me a.s.a.p. (there's a public call closing on February 7th, 2024) using the email address at the bottom of the page.
