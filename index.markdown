# Who am I

I will be a **Ramón y Cajal senior researcher** at the Universidad de Oviedo and ICTEA starting January 2023. Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN postdoc and then FNRS chargé de recherche, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. I got my bachelor and master's degrees from Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy).

My research focuses on the exploration of **high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent**, eventually powered by **quantum algorithms**, and on the extension of machine learning methods to **realistic neurons** with **spiking networks**.

**I co-founded and am part of the steering committee of the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/)**, where we focus on experiment design powered by machine-learning-based optimization.

I also **apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data**, within the [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration), to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

My CMS-related responsibilities include being a **coordinator of the CERN IML** (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group, member of the **CMS Statistics Committee** (an advisory committee on topics concerning statistics), plus other responsibilities (e.g. Higgs-WW convener) within the CMS Collaboration.

# Research Group

I am currently building my own research group. If you would like to work with me, either at the bachelor, master's, PhD, or postdoc level, please write me an email at the address below.

I often have some available smaller projects, suitable to interested students who want to acquire some experience or try out research work without (yet?) committing to a bachelor, master's, or PhD thesis. Again, if you are interested please write me an email at the address below.
