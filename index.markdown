# Who am I

I am a **Ramón y Cajal senior researcher** at the Universidad de Oviedo and [ICTEA](https://ictea.uniovi.es/). Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN postdoc and then FNRS chargé de recherche, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. I got my bachelor and master's degrees from Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy).

My research focuses on the exploration of **high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent**, eventually powered by **quantum algorithms**, and on the extension of machine learning methods to **realistic neurons** with **spiking networks**, to be then implemented in **neuromorphic hardware devices**.

**I co-founded and am part of the steering committee of the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/)**, where we focus on experiment design powered by machine-learning-based optimization.

I also **apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data**, within the [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration), to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

Within ICTEA, I aim at **bridging and promoting cross-contamination** between different disciplines by the development and application of state-of-the-art and novel **artificial intelligence techniques**.

My CMS-related responsibilities include being a **coordinator of the CERN IML** (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group, member of the **CMS Statistics Committee** (an advisory committee on topics concerning statistics), plus other responsibilities (e.g. HWW convener) within the CMS Collaboration.

For CMS activities, I joined the excellent [UniOviHEP-ICTEA CMS group](https://www.hep.uniovi.es/).

# Research Group

NeuroMODE (my main project): I am currently building my own research group. If you would like to work with me, either at the bachelor, master's, PhD, or postdoc level, please write me an email at the address below.

I may have smaller projects to offer, suitable to interested students who want to acquire some experience or try out research work without (yet?) committing to a bachelor, master's, or PhD thesis. Again, if you are interested please write me an email at the address below.

### Current students/postdocs

- Mariam Safieldin (American University of Beirut), internship (UCLouvain/UniOvi, funded by UCLouvain's muon tomography group)
- Adrián Fernández Alonso, bachelor thesis (UniOvi)
