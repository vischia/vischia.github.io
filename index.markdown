# Who am I

I am a **Ramón y Cajal senior researcher** at the Universidad de Oviedo and [ICTEA](https://ictea.uniovi.es/), and **Adjunct Professor** at IITM. Previously I have been a postdoc at Université catholique de Louvain (Belgium, IISN postdoc and then FNRS chargé de recherche, 2018-2022), Universidad de Oviedo (2016-2018), and I got my PhD from Instituto Superior Técnico (Lisboa, Portugal) in 2016. I got my bachelor and master's degrees from Università degli Studi di Padova (Italy).

My research focuses on the exploration of **high-dimensional spaces via gradient descent**, eventually powered by **quantum algorithms**, and on the extension of machine learning methods to **realistic neurons** with **spiking networks**, to be then implemented in **neuromorphic hardware devices**. I have created my research group in Universidad of Oviedo and ICTEA, focussed on this main research avenue.

**I co-founded and am the coordinator of the [MODE Collaboration](https://mode-collaboration.github.io/)**, where we focus on experiment design powered by machine-learning-based optimization.

Within ICTEA, I aim at **bridging and promoting cross-contamination** between different disciplines by the development and application of state-of-the-art and novel **artificial intelligence techniques**.

I also **apply machine learning algorithms to LHC data**, within the [CMS Collaboration](https://cms.cern/collaboration), to study the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttH) in final states with many leptons, the properties of the associated production of a W and a Z boson, and the search production of a pair of Higgs boson.

My CMS-related responsibilities include being the **coordinator of the Machine Learning Group of the CMS Experiment for the years 2024-2026**, member of the **CMS Statistics Committee** (an advisory committee on topics concerning statistics), plus other responsibilities (e.g. HWW convener) within the CMS Collaboration. Until 2024.09, I have been the**coordinator of the CERN IML** (Interexperimental Machine Learning) Working Group.

For what concerns my activities in the CMS Collaboration, I joined the excellent [UniOviHEP-ICTEA CMS group](https://www.hep.uniovi.es/).

# My Research Group

**NeuroModelling** (my main project): I am currently building **my own research group**. If you would like to work with me, either at the bachelor, master's, PhD, or postdoc level, please write me an email at the address below.

I may have smaller projects to offer, suitable to interested students who want to acquire some experience or try out research work without (yet?) committing to a bachelor, master's, or PhD thesis. Again, if you are interested please write me an email at the address below.

### Current Postdocs

- If you got your PhD between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2024, and you are interested in a postdoc with me, please contact me a.s.a.p. using the email address at the bottom of the page. There will be a call closing on February 2025.
    

### Current PhD students

- If you are interested in applying to Spanish funding agencies for funding for a PhD with me, please contact me (email address at the bottom of the page). In particular, there will be a call open to people who resided in Spain for 12 months in the last 36 months, closing on February 2025.
